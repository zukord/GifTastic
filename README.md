# GifTastic

Clicking a button creates 10 images, and clicking on one of the imagess turns it into an animated GIF. You can also make your own button by typing it into the box and hitting submit.

I ended up replacing the static fixed height images with original size animated GIFs, as it would appear to be the correct functionality for such a page, you'd want the original resolution on the image you're focused on.

I'm not sure if my answer for how to switch out the source between images was exactly what the instructions were looking for, but it was a creative solution and it solves the issue as long as the program uses the Giphy API.
